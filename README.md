# How to run the app?

1. Run `composer install`
2. Run `npm install`
   
Then start the dev servers:

- CakePHP server via `bin/cake server` - Open website on the port of this server

- Run the Vite dev server via `npx vite` - This is used for hot reloading


Now try making changes to App.vue or to home.php. In both cases you should see the changes appear automatically in the browser.
